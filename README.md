# What is here:
This repository is a workspace for developing and maintaining vocabularies to support interoperable sample-based analytical data from astromaterials. 

## Geochemistry folder
Vocabularies for for analytical techniques in geochemistry and cosmochemistry.  The directory contains SKOS vocabulary drafts, serialized using turtle (ttl). HTML versions are generated in the *html* folders in this repo using the scripts in the *scripts* folder on the pages branch.  The html is accessible on the github.io pages for the repo, links included in vocabulary descriptions.

### Analytical methods for geochemistry and cosmochemistry
Vocabulary of analytical techniques for analyzing Earth,  astronomic, and planetary materials.

### GeoXAnalyticalTechnique.ttl
SKOS vocabualary, serialized using Turtle. Based on Geo-X spreadsheet from Manja Luzi (GFZ Potsdam), with some general categories added to fill out the hierarchy.

## Extraterrestrial materials folder (ETmaterials)

This folder contains development work for a vocabulary to classify types of meteorites and other extraterrestrial (ET) materials. Classes based on Meteorite Bulletin (MetBull) classes that were extracted into Mindat. Some MetBull classes are not included in Mindat and will be added. There are some lunar materials based on Apollo return samples, and links to a few terrestrial material classes that subsume the ET material.

### Extraterrestrial Materials classes
Vocabulary of categories of meteorites and lunar materials.

### Minerals
Draft vocabulary for mineral species. Information pulled from Wikipedia, RRUFF, and MinDat.  Includes hierarchy from Strunz classes and Mindat mineral groups.
