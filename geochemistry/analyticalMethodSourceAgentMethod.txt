<https://w3id.org/geochem/1.0/agent/astromat>	Astromaterials Data System (Astromat)	"Analytical methods cited in the Astromat database.  The database currently contains a compilation of data acquired from meteorites and lunar samples returned by the Apollo missions. The Astromaterials Data System (Astromat, https://www.astromat.org/about/overview/) is a comprehensive data infrastructure to access, publish, and preserve laboratory analytical data generated on astromaterials samples. Astromat aims to ensure the long-term value of astromaterials samples data and maximize their impact on scientific discovery and knowledge."	
<https://w3id.org/geochem/1.0/agent/orex>	OSIRIS-REx Sample Analysis Team	"Analytical methods planned for the investigation of sample material returned from asteroid Bennu by the OSIRIS-REx mission (https://www.asteroidmission.org/). Some method descriptions that only have orex listed as source are from the O-REx Confluence web content. The mission sample analysis team has been compiling descriptions of analytical techniques planned, and the dictionary of planned methods has been shared with Astromat data managers and been made available for this compilation.

<https://w3id.org/geochem/1.0/agent/metbase>	Meteorite Information Database (Metbase)	"Analytical methods requested based on metbase data. Metbase is a compilation of meteorite data published between 1492 and today, built by scientists for scientists and released exclusively online. More than 500,000 data of meteorite analyses are stored in MetBase, including Bulk chemical compositions, Major/minor/trace elements in iron meteorites, Mineral chemistry, Cosmogenic radionuclides, Light stable isotopes, Noble gas isotopes, TL data, porosities, and densities."	
<https://w3id.org/geochem/1.0/agent/georoc>	Geochemistry of Rocks of the Oceans and Continents (GEOROC)	"GEOROC (https://georoc.eu/) is a comprehensive collection of published analyses of igneous and metamorphic rocks and minerals. It contains major and trace element concentrations, radiogenic and nonradiogenic isotope ratios as well as analytical ages for whole rocks, glasses, minerals and inclusions. Metadata include geospatial and other sample information, analytical details and references. Digital Geochemical Data Infrastructure (DIGIS) will continue and enhance GEOROC, originally curated by the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. Labels for analytical methods from GEOROC were compiled by Marthe Klocking, University of Gottingen, Germany, and in collaboration with Annika Johansson (IEDA, Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, see PetDB agent) mapped to labels for techniques from PetDB; the compilation included definitions that were reviewed and enhances in some cased in this vocabulary."
